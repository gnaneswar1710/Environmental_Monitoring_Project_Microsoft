#Environmental Monitoring Description

This project examines near real-time satellite imagery to identify environmental changes, including deforestation, urban expansion , and water bodies shrinkage, using pixel differencing methods. Satellite images from sources such as NASA Worldview and ISRO Bhuvan undergo preprocessing to eliminate cloud interference and standardize resolution. By comparing pixel values from multi-temporal images, changes over time are identified.

Results are presented through an interactive Streamlit dashboard. The system is applicable for various real-world scenarios in environmental monitoring, urban development, and disaster response.
